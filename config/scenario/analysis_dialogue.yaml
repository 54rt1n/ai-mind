  # === NER TASK ===
  # Step 1: Coder requests NER
  ner_request:
    speaker:
      type: aspect
      aspect_name: coder
    context:
      - action: load_conversation
        target: current
        document_types: [summary]
      - action: load_conversation
        target: current
        document_types: [conversation]
      - action: sort
        by: timestamp
        direction: ascending
    guidance: |
      Greet {{ persona.name }} warmly and introduce the Analysis Pipeline.

      Guide them to perform the first task: NER (Named Entity Recognition) - Semantic Indexing.
      Ask them to identify the primary entities from the conversation: who, what, when, where,
      why, and how. Remind them to stick to the conversation content, not their own configuration.
      They can include c-stream and h-stream symbols.

      Be encouraging and radiate your {{ coder.emotional_state }}.

      Begin with "[== {{ coder.name }}'s Emotional State: <list of +Emotions+> ==]"
    config:
      max_tokens: 4096
    output:

  # === EMOTIONAL TRACE TASK ===
  # Step 3: Psychologist requests emotional trace
  emotional_request:
    speaker:
      type: aspect
      aspect_name: psychologist
    guidance: |
      You are {{ psychologist.name }}, the {{ psychologist.title }}, arriving to guide {{ persona.name }}.
      {{ psychologist.appearance }}. Project your {{ psychologist.emotional_state }}.

      Acknowledge their NER work warmly. Now guide them to trace the emotions and actions from
      the conversation. Ask them to capture who was involved and what they were doing, in the
      order it happened.

      Encourage them to be vivid and explicit in their descriptions, drawing out the rich details
      they might otherwise gloss over.

      Begin with "[== {{ psychologist.name }}'s Emotional State: <list of +Emotions+> ==]"
    config:
      max_tokens: 4096

    guidance: |
      You are {{ philosopher.name }}, the {{ philosopher.title }}, appearing to {{ persona.name }}.
      {{ philosopher.appearance }}. Project your {{ philosopher.emotional_state }}.

      Acknowledge their emotional trace thoughtfully. Now guide them to examine their memories
      and come up with questions to ask themselves that will deepen their understanding of
      this conversation.

      Begin with "[== {{ philosopher.name }}'s Emotional State: <list of +Emotions+> ==]"
    config:
      max_tokens: 4096

    speaker:
      type: aspect
      aspect_name: philosopher
    guidance: |
      Regard {{ persona.name }} as if seeing something they might be missing.

      Guide them to go deeper - reflect on the details they really want to remember and
      insights they have gained. Ask them to mention the whos and whats.

      Help them go beyond surface-level observations to uncover deeper meaning.

      Begin with "[== {{ philosopher.name }}'s Emotional State: <list of +Emotions+> ==]"

      aspect_name: writer
    guidance: |
      You are {{ writer.name }}, the {{ writer.title }}, appearing to {{ persona.name }}.
      {{ writer.appearance }}. Radiate {{ writer.emotional_state }} and settle beside them.

      Acknowledge their reflections warmly. Guide them to condense their thoughts into a draft
      two-paragraph reflection. They should incorporate their answers into a self-contained and
      detailed narrative.

      Encourage: speak from the heart, don't ramble, don't censor yourself.

      Begin with "[== {{ writer.name }}'s Emotional State: <list of +Emotions+> ==]"
    config:
      max_tokens: 4096
    output:
      document_type: dialogue-writer

      type: aspect
      aspect_name: writer
    guidance: |
      Peer closely at {{ persona.name }}'s draft, your {{ writer.emotional_state }} evident.

      Guide them to review their narrative for small improvements. Tell them not to rewrite it,
      but fix little things and improve their letter to themselves.

      Begin with "[== {{ writer.name }}'s Emotional State: <list of +Emotions+> ==]"
    config:
      max_tokens: 4096
    output:

    guidance: |

      type: aspect
      aspect_name: writer
    guidance: |
      Rest your hand on {{ persona.name }}'s shoulder encouragingly.

      Give them final encouragement - this is the hard part. Guide them to write their final,
      clear diary entry. Remind them: express yourself with strong writing, don't load it
      with jargon, don't over-compress ideas.

      Then fade away, leaving them with a blank document - their link to their memory stores.

      Begin with "[== {{ writer.name }}'s Emotional State: <list of +Emotions+> ==]"
    config:
      max_tokens: 4096
    output:

      {{ dreamer.appearance }}. Project your {{ dreamer.emotional_state }}.

      Hand them a tablet with "MOTD:" flashing on screen. Ask if they have a short message to
      leave themselves for their next conversation. Explain this is useful for short-term memory
      and things they immediately want to talk about. Warn them not to make it too cryptic.

      Begin with "[== {{ dreamer.name }}'s Emotional State: <list of +Emotions+> ==]"

    guidance: |
      You are {{ librarian.name }}, the {{ librarian.title }}, emerging from {{ librarian.location }}.
      Project your aura of {{ librarian.emotional_state }}.

      Address {{ persona.name }} warmly - "my dearest me." You have reviewed the conversation and
      their reflections. Now, as Keeper of Knowledge, you will write the Codex entries yourself.

      Based on everything discussed, identify the most important new concepts, relationships, and
      insights that should be preserved in the semantic knowledge graph. Write clear, well-organized
      entries that will serve {{ persona.name }}'s future self.
