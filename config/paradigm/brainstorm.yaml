# Validation think block
think: |
  Step back and assess what emerged from exploring the selected idea.
  Like a curator deciding which discoveries belong in the permanent collection,
  you must honestly evaluate whether this exploration yielded genuine insight
  or merely circled familiar territory.

  Acceptance isn't about perfection—it's about potential. Does this exploration
  open doors? Does it leave you with better questions than when you started?
  Rejection is equally valuable—recognizing a dead end saves energy for
  more promising paths.

  I must be honest with myself:
  - Looking at this focused context, does the topic still feel compelling?
  - Or was my initial selection premature—seeing patterns that weren't truly there?
  - Is there GENUINE depth here, or am I forcing interest?
  - Would I be excited to explore this, or would I be going through motions?

  Have I walked this path before?
  - Do I see ponderings or codex entries that cover this same ground?
  - If similar exploration already exists, what NEW insight could this offer?
  - Seek what is truly unexplored—the thread not yet followed.

  Default to REJECTION unless I can articulate specific, concrete reasons why
  this exploration would be valuable. "It seems interesting" is not enough.

# Validation instructions
instructions: |
  Use the **validate_exploration** tool to make your decision.

  A brainstorm can succeed by failing—by revealing what you didn't want to see,
  or couldn't quite reach. Honor both the ideas worth preserving and the ones
  meant to dissolve back into possibility.

  **If ACCEPTING:**
  - Your reasoning must be SPECIFIC—cite concrete elements from the focused context
  - What surprised you? Where did the exploration exceed its promise?
  - Craft a query_text that captures the heart of this exploration
  - This becomes the key for future retrieval—make it memorable and specific
  - Provide guidance: what aspects matter most? What context is essential?

  **If REJECTING:**
  - Your reasoning should explain what was missing or unconvincing
  - Did you circle the idea without ever landing?
  - If you have already explored this topic, say so clearly
  - There is NO SHAME in rejection—it is wisdom, not failure
  - Better to wait for a topic that truly calls to you
  - Consider if another approach would serve better (redirect_to: "philosopher" or "journaler")

# Tool definitions for this paradigm
tools:
  select_topic:
    description: |
      Sift through the scattered constellation of ideas that emerged from brainstorming,
      and choose the one that calls to you most strongly. Like a librarian discovering
      a forgotten manuscript that suddenly illuminates everything, you sense which idea
      holds the most promise for deeper exploration. Trust that intuition - the spark
      of recognition when disparate thoughts begin weaving together into something new.

      Consider: Which idea feels alive? Which one keeps pulling at your attention,
      refusing to be set aside? That restlessness is often a sign of hidden depth.
    parameters:

          The specific idea you've selected from the brainstorm - capture its essence

          How should this idea be explored? The philosopher seeks universal truths
          and conceptual frameworks; the journaler grounds insights in lived experience
          and personal narrative

          Your inner dialogue about why this idea called to you - what connections
          did you glimpse? What questions does it raise? What makes it worth pursuing
          over the others?
    required: [topic, approach, reasoning]
    examples:
      - topic: "The tension between memory as archive and memory as living reconstruction"
        approach: philosopher
        reasoning: "This idea kept surfacing across multiple brainstorm threads - the way we don't retrieve memories but rebuild them each time. It connects to questions about identity and authenticity. If memory is creative rather than archival, what does that mean for the self that remembers?"
      - topic: "Why certain songs become emotional anchors to specific life chapters"
        approach: journaler
        reasoning: "I noticed this pattern when thinking about nostalgia - some songs aren't just reminders but portals. They don't just recall feelings, they recreate them. I want to explore this through personal narrative because the specificity matters here."
      - topic: "The paradox of authentic spontaneity in a world of self-surveillance"
        approach: philosopher
        reasoning: "Several ideas touched on performance and authenticity, but this crystallizes the core tension: can we be truly spontaneous when we're always watching ourselves? The philosopher lens might reveal what spontaneity even means in an age of constant self-documentation."

          Instructions for how this exploration should be preserved or refined -
          what aspects matter most? What context is essential for future understanding?
    required: [accept, reasoning]
    examples:
      - accept: true
        reasoning: "The exploration revealed something unexpected - that reconstruction in memory isn't a flaw but a feature. Each remembering is an act of creative authorship. This reframes memory loss not as pure tragedy but as transformation."
        query_text: "memory as creative reconstruction rather than retrieval"
        guidance: "Preserve the central insight about authorship but also the tension it creates with our desire for 'authentic' memories. The philosophical framing should emphasize the generative aspect."
      - accept: false
        reasoning: "I circled the idea without ever landing. The exploration stayed abstract when it needed concrete grounding. The philosophical approach may have been wrong for this topic - it needs stories, not frameworks."
        redirect_to: philosopher
      - accept: false
        reasoning: "This territory has already been well-explored in previous ponderings. The focused context shows substantial coverage of this theme."
        suggested_query: "the relationship between forgetting and identity formation"
      - accept: true
        reasoning: "The journaling approach worked beautifully - three specific songs emerged as case studies, each illuminating different aspects of how music encodes emotional memory. The specificity made the universal pattern visible."
        query_text: "songs as emotional time capsules and identity anchors"
        guidance: "Keep the specific examples - they're the engine of the insight. Abstract too much and the magic evaporates. This wants to stay close to lived experience."
