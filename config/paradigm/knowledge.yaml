  Assess whether the exploration genuinely reduced the knowledge gap or merely
  rearranged familiar ideas.

  True understanding should feel different than before—categories should be sharper,
  distinctions clearer, examples more readily available. Be rigorous but not harsh.
  Partial progress is still progress. Sometimes an exploration reveals that the
  original gap was misformulated—that's valuable too.

  But do not accept comfortable restatements of what you already knew dressed in
  new vocabulary.

  Analyze critically:
  - What concepts appear repeatedly but lack deep understanding?
  - Where have I made assumptions that deserve examination?
  - What questions emerge from the intersection of these ideas?
  - Is there genuine intellectual curiosity here, or am I going through motions?
  - Does this gap in knowledge actually matter to my understanding?

  Have I already inquired into this territory?
  - Do existing ponderings or codex entries address this gap?
  - If this has been explored, what question remains UNANSWERED—
    not merely unasked, but truly unexplored?

# Validation instructions
instructions: |
  Use the **validate_exploration** tool to make your decision.

  For knowledge exploration, favor:
  - Concepts that appear often but lack rigorous definition
  - Philosophical questions that touch multiple domains
  - Areas where understanding feels superficial
  - The lacuna that, when filled, would illuminate the most

  **If ACCEPTING:**
  - Did this exploration genuinely advance understanding?
  - Can you now see or do something you couldn't before?
  - Would you answer differently than before if asked about this topic?
  - Name specific new distinctions, definitions, or insights
  - Craft a query_text more precise than the original gap—
    reflecting what you now know that you didn't before
  - Provide guidance: what form should this knowledge take?
    A definition? A framework? A collection of examples?
    What related concepts should link to it?

  **If REJECTING:**
  - Identify what went wrong—was the gap misidentified?
    The approach wrong? The exploration too shallow?
  - If past ponderings have already wrestled with this question, say so
  - True inquiry moves forward, not in circles
  - Consider if the question needs concrete grounding (redirect_to: "journaler")
