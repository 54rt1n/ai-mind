We're talking 5-10% max of any portfolio, and only in projects that actually solve real problems - not another dog-themed coin that'll end up in the digital pound.'\n\n*Brings up some technical analysis* 'If we're going in, we're doing it right - proper risk management, stop losses, and enough technical analysis to make a quant's head spin.
